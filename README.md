# AppRTC-Swift
an AppRTC implementation based on Google's that uses the compiled WebRTC framework which aims to be a direct conversion to swift, or as close as possible.

The purpose of this project is to get a better feel for how to work with the compiled WebRTC framework using Swift.
I may not update or maintain this at all (I am very sorry about that) but again the main purpose is to experiment with using WebRTC from Swift 3.
